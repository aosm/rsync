rsync 2.5.2 (26 Jan 2002)

  SECURITY FIXES:

    * Signedness security patch from Sebastian Krahmer
      <krahmer@suse.de> -- in some cases we were not sufficiently
      careful about reading integers from the network.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix possible string mangling in log files.

    * Fix for setting local address of outgoing sockets.

    * Better handling of hardlinks and devices on platforms with
      64-bit dev_t or ino_t.

    * Name resolution on machines supporting IPv6 is improved.

    * Fix for device nodes.  (dann frazier)   (Debian #129135)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With -v, rsync now shows the command used to initiate an ssh/rsh
      connection.

    * --statistics now shows memory heap usage on platforms that
        support mallinfo().

    * "The Ted T'so school of program optimization": make progress
      visible and people will think it's faster.  (With --progress,
      rsync will show you how many files it has seen as it builds the
      file_list, giving some indication that it has not hung.)

    * Improvements to batch mode support.  This is still experimental
      but testing would be welcome.   (Jos Backus)
 
    * New --ignore-existing option, patch previously distributed with
      Vipul's Razor.  (Debian #124286)
