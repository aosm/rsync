NEWS for rsync 2.6.2 (30 Apr 2004)
Protocol: 28 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.1:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a major bug in the sorting of the filenames when --relative
      is used for some sources (just sources such as "/" and "/*" were
      affected).  This fix ensures that we ask for the right file-list
      item when requesting changes from the sender.

    - Rsync now checks the return value of the close() function to
      better report disk-full problems on an NFS file system.

    - Restored the old daemon-server behavior of logging error messages
      rather than returning them to the user.  (A better long-term fix
      will be sought in the future.)

    - An obscure uninitialized-variable bug was fixed in the uid/gid
      code.  (This bug probably had no ill effects.)

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Got rid of the configure check for sys/sysctl.h (it wasn't used
      and was causing a problem on some systems).  Also improved the
      broken-largefile-locking test to try to avoid failure due to an
      NFS build-dir.

    - Fixed a compile problem on systems that don't define
      AI_NUMERICHOST.

    - Fixed a compile problem in the popt source for compilers that
      don't support __attribute__.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Improved the testsuite's "merge" test to work on OSF1.

    - Two new diffs were added to the patches dir.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.1 (26 Apr 2004)
Protocol: 28 (changed)
Changes since 2.6.0:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    - Paths sent to an rsync daemon are more thoroughly sanitized when
      chroot is not used.  If you're running a non-read-only rsync
      daemon with chroot disabled, *please upgrade*, ESPECIALLY if the
      user privs you run rsync under is anything above "nobody".

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Lower memory use, more optimal transfer of data over the socket,
      and lower CPU usage (see the INTERNAL section for details).

    - The RSYNC_PROXY environment variable can now contain a
      "USER:PASS@" prefix before the "HOST:PORT" information.
      (Bardur Arantsson)

    - The --progress output now mentions how far along in the transfer
      we are, including both a count of files transferred and a
      percentage of the total file-count that we've processed.  It also
      shows better current-rate-of-transfer and remaining-transfer-time
      values.

    - Documentation changes now attempt to describe some often mis-
      understood features more clearly.

  BUG FIXES:

    - When -x (--one-file-system) is combined with -L (--copy-links) or
      --copy-unsafe-links, no symlinked files are skipped, even if the
      referent file is on a different filesystem.

    - The --link-dest code now works properly for a non-root user when
      (1) the UIDs of the source and destination differ and -o was
      specified, or (2) when the group of the source can't be used on
      the destination and -g was specified.

    - Fixed a bug in the handling of -H (hard-links) that might cause
      the expanded PATH/NAME value of the current item to get
      overwritten (due to an expanded-name caching bug).
      
    - We now reset the "new data has been sent" flag at the start of
      each file we send.  This makes sure that an interrupted transfer
      with the --partial option set doesn't keep a shorter temp file
      than the current basis file when no new data has been transfered
      over the wire for that file.

    - Fixed a byte-order problem in --batch-mode on big-endian machines.
      (Jay Fenlason)

    - When using --cvs-exclude, the exclude items we get from a
      per-directory's .cvsignore file once again only affect that one
      directory (not all following directories too).  The items are also
      now properly word-split and parsed without any +/- prefix parsing.

    - When specifying the USER@HOST: prefix for a file, the USER part
      can now contain an '@', if needed (i.e. the last '@' is used to
      find the HOST, not the first).

    - Fixed some bugs in the handling of group IDs for non-root users:
      (1) It properly handles a group that the sender didn't have a name
      for (it would previously skip changing the group on any files in
      that group).  (2) If --numeric-ids is used, rsync no longer
      attempts to set groups that the user doesn't have the permission
      to set.

    - Fixed the "refuse options" setting in the rsyncd.conf file.

    - Improved the -x (--one-file-system) flag's handling of any mount-
      point directories we encounter.  It is both more optimal (in that
      it no longer does a useless scan of the contents of the mount-
      point dirs) and also fixes a bug where a remapped mount of the
      original filesystem could get discovered in a subdir we should be
      ignoring.

    - Rsync no longer discards a double-slash at the start of a filename
      when trying to open the file.  It also no longer constructs names
      that start with a double slash (unless the user supplied them).

    - Path-specifying options to a daemon should now work the same with
      or without chroot turned on.  Previously, such a option (such as
      --link-dest) would get its absolute path munged into a relative
      one if chroot was not on, making that setting fairly useless.
      Rsync now transforms the path into one that is based on the
      module's base dir when chroot is not enabled.

    - Fixed a compatibility problem interacting with older rsync
      versions that might send us an empty --suffix value without
      telling us that --backup-dir was specified.

    - The "hosts allow" option for a daemon-over-remote-shell process
      now has improved support for IPv6 addresses and a fix for systems
      that have a length field in their socket structs.

    - Fixed the ability to request an empty backup --suffix when sending
      files to an rsync daemon.

  INTERNAL:

    - Most of the I/O is now buffered, which results in a pretty large
      speedup when running under MS Windows.  (Craig Barratt)

    - Optimizations to the name-handling/comparing code have made some
      significant reductions in user-CPU time for large file sets.

    - Some cleanup of the variable types make the code more consistent.

    - Reduced memory requirements of hard link preservation.
      (J.W. Schultz)

    - Implemented a new algorithm for hard-link handling that speeds up
      the code significantly.  (J.W. Schultz and Wayne Davison)

    - The --hard-link option now uses the first existing file in the
      group of linked files as the basis for the transfer.  This
      prevents the sub-optimal transfer of a file's data when a new
      hardlink is added on the sending side and it sorts alphabetically
      earlier in the list than the files that are already present on the
      receiving side.

    - Dropped support for protocol versions less than 20 (2.3.0 released
      15 Mar 1999) and activated warnings for protocols less than 25
      (2.5.0 released 23 Aug 2001). (Wayne Davison and J.W. Schultz,
      severally)

    - More optimal data transmission for --hard-links (protocol 28).

    - More optimal data transmission for --checksum (protocol 28).

    - Less memory is used when --checksum is specified.

    - Less memory is used in the file list (a per-file savings).

    - The generator is now better about not modifying the file list
      during the transfer in order to avoid a copy-on-write memory
      bifurcation (on systems where fork() uses shared memory).
      Previously, rsync's shared memory would slowly become unshared,
      resulting in real memory usage nearly doubling on the receiving
      side by the end of the transfer.  Now, as long as permissions
      are being preserved, the shared memory should remain that way
      for the entire transfer.

    - Changed hardlink info and file_struct + strings to use allocation
      pools.  This reduces memory use for large file-sets and permits
      freeing memory to the OS.  (J.W. Schultz) 

    - The 2 pipes used between the receiver and generator processes
      (which are forked on the same machine) were reduced to 1 pipe and
      the protocol improved so that (1) it is now impossible to have the
      "redo" pipe fill up and hang rsync, and (2) trailing messages from
      the receiver don't get lost on their way through the generator
      over to the sender (which mainly affected hard-link messages and
      verbose --stats output).

    - Improved the internal uid/gid code to be more portable and a
      little more optimized.

    - The device numbers sent when using --devices are now sent as
      separate major/minor values with 32-bit accuracy (protocol 28).
      Previously, the copied devices were sent as a single 32-bit
      number.  This will make inter-operation of 64-bit binaries more
      compatible with their 32-bit brethren (with both ends of the
      connection are using protocol 28).  Note that optimizations in the
      binary protocol for sending the device numbers often results in
      fewer bytes being used than before, even though more precision is
      now available.

    - Some cleanup of the exclude/include structures and its code made
      things clearer (internally), simpler, and more efficient.

    - The reading & writing of the file-list in batch-mode is now
      handled by the same code that sends & receives the list over the
      wire.  This makes it much easier to maintain.  (Note that the
      batch code is still considered to be experimental.)

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - The configure script now accepts --with-rsyncd-conf=PATH to
      override the default value of the /etc/rsyncd.conf file.

    - Fixed configure bug when running "./configure --disable-ipv6".

    - Fixed compilation problem on Tru64 Unix (having to do with
      sockaddr.sa_len and sockaddr.sin_len).

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Fixed "make test" bug when build dir is not the source dir.

    - Added a couple extra diffs in the "patches" dir, removed the ones
      that got applied, and rebuilt the rest.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.0 (1 Jan 2004)
Protocol: 27 (changed)
Changes since 2.5.7:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * "ssh" is now the default remote shell for rsync.  If you want to
      change this, configure like this:  "./configure --with-rsh=rsh".

    * Added --files-from, --no-relative, --no-implied-dirs, and --from0.
      Note that --from0 affects the line-ending character for all the
      files read by the --*-from options. (Wayne Davison)

    * Length of csum2 is now per-file starting with protocol version
      27. (J.W. Schultz)

    * Per-file dynamic block size is now sqrt(file length).  The
      per-file checksum size is determined according to an algorithm
      provided by Donovan Baarda which reduces the probability of rsync
      algorithm corrupting data and falling back using the whole md4
      checksums. (J.W. Schultz, Donovan Baarda)

    * The --stats option no longer includes the (debug) malloc summary
      unless the verbose option was specified at least twice.

    * Added a new error/warning code for when files vanish from the
      sending side.  Made vanished source files not interfere with the
      file-deletion pass when --delete-after was specified.

    * Various trailing-info sections are now preceded by a newline.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed several exclude/include matching bugs when using wild-cards.
      This has a several user-visible effects, all of which make the
      matching more consistent and intuitive.  This should hopefully not
      cause anyone problems since it makes the matching work more like
      what people are expecting. (Wayne Davison)

      - A pattern with a "**" no longer causes a "*" to match slashes.
        For example, with "/*/foo/**", "foo" must be 2 levels deep.
	[If your string has BOTH "*" and "**" wildcards, changing the
	"*" wildcards to "**" will provide the old behavior in all
	versions.]

      - "**/foo" now matches at the base of the transfer (like /foo
        does).  [Use "/**/foo" to get the old behavior in all versions.]

      - A non-anchored wildcard term floats to match beyond the base of
        the transfer.  E.g. "CVS/R*" matches at the end of the path,
        just like the non-wildcard term "CVS/Root" does. [Use "/CVS/R*"
        to get the old behavior in all versions.]

      - Including a "**" in the match term causes it to be matched
        against the entire path, not just the name portion, even if
        there aren't any interior slashes in the term.  E.g. "foo**bar"
        would exclude "/path/foo-bar" (just like before) as well as
        "/foo-path/baz-bar" (unlike before).  [Use "foo*bar" to get the
        old behavior in all versions.]

    * The exclude list specified in the daemon's config file is now
      properly applied to the pulled items no matter how deep the
      user's file-args are in the source tree.  (Wayne Davison)

    * For protocol version >= 27, mdfour_tail() is called when the
      block size (including checksum_seed) is a multiple of 64.
      Previously it was not called, giving the wrong MD4 checksum.
      (Craig Barratt)

    * For protocol version >= 27, a 64 bit bit counter is used in
      mdfour.c as required by the RFC.  Previously only a 32 bit bit
      counter was used, causing incorrect MD4 file checksums for
      file sizes >= 512MB - 4.  (Craig Barratt)

    * Fixed a crash bug when interacting with older rsync versions and
      multiple files of the same name are destined for the same dir.
      (Wayne Davison)

    * Keep tmp names from overflowing MAXPATHLEN.

    * Make --link-dest honor the absence of -p, -o, and -g.

    * Made rsync treat a trailing slash in the destination in a more
      consistent manner.

    * Fixed file I/O error detection.  (John Van Essen)

    * Fixed bogus "malformed address {hostname}" message in rsyncd log
      when checking IP address against hostnames from "hosts allow"
      and "hosts deny" parameters in config file.

    * Print heap statistics when verbose >= 2 instead of when >= 1.

    * Fixed a compression (-z) bug when syncing a mostly-matching file
      that contains already-compressed data.  (Yasuoka Masahiko and
      Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed a bug in the --backup code that could cause deleted files
      to not get backed up.

    * When the backup code makes new directories, create them with mode
      0700 instead of 0755 (since the directory permissions in the
      backup tree are not yet copied from the main tree).

    * Call setgroups() in a more portable manner.

    * Improved file-related error messages to better indicate exactly
      what pathname failed. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed some bugs in the handling of --delete and --exclude when
      using the --relative (-R) option. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed bug that prevented regular files from replacing
      special files and caused a directory in --link-dest or
      --compare-dest to block the creation of a file with the
      same path.  A directory still cannot be replaced by a
      regular file unless --delete specified.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * Detect and report when open or opendir succeed but read and
      readdir fail caused by network filesystem issues and truncated
      files.  (David Norwood, Michael Brown, J.W. Schultz)

    * Added a fix that should give ssh time to restore the tty settings
      if the user presses Ctrl-C at an ssh password prompt.

  INTERNAL:

    * Eliminated vestigial support for old versions that we stopped
      supporting. (J.W. Schultz)

    * Simplified some of the option-parsing code. (Wayne Davison)

    * Some cleanup made to the exclude code, as well as some new
      defines added to enhance readability. (Wayne Davison)

    * Changed the protocol-version code so that it can interact at a
      lower protocol level than the maximum supported by both sides.
      Added an undocumented option, --protocol=N, to force the value
      we advertise to the other side (primarily for testing purposes).
      (Wayne Davison)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.7 (4 Dec 2003)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)

NEWS for rsync 2.5.6, aka "the dwd-between-jobs release" (26 Jan 2003)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.5:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * The --delete-after option now implies --delete.  (Wayne Davison)

    * The --suffix option can now be used with --backup-dir.  (Michael
      Zimmerman)

    * Combining "::" syntax with the -rsh/-e option now uses the
      specified remote-shell as a transport to talk to a (newly-spawned)
      server-daemon.  This allows someone to use daemon features, such
      as modules, over a secure protocol, such as ssh.  (JD Paul)

    * The rsync:// syntax for daemon connections is now accepted in the
      destination field.

    * If the file name given to --include-from or --exclude-from is "-",
      rsync will read from standard input.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * New option --link-dest which is like --compare-dest except that
      unchanged files are hard-linked in to the destination directory.
      (J.W. Schultz)

    * Don't report an error if an excluded file disappears during an
      rsync run.  (Eugene Chupriyanov and Bo Kersey)

    * Added .svn to --cvs-exclude list to support subversion.  (Jon
      Middleton)

    * Properly support IPv6 addresses in the rsyncd.conf "hosts allow"
      and "hosts deny" fields.  (Hideaki Yoshifuji)

    * Changed exclude file handling to permit DOS or MAC style line
      terminations.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * Ignore errors from chmod when -p/-a/--preserve-perms is not set.
      (Dave Dykstra)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix "forward name lookup failed" errors on AIX 4.3.3.  (John
      L. Allen, Martin Pool)

    * Generate each file's rolling-checksum data as we send it, not
      in a separate (memory-eating) pass before hand.  This prevents
      timeout errors on really large files. (Stefan Nehlsen)

    * Fix compilation on Tru64.  (Albert Chin, Zoong Pham)

    * Better handling of some client-server errors.  (Martin Pool)

    * Fixed a crash that would occur when sending a list of files that
      contains a duplicate name (if it sorts to the end of the file
      list) and using --delete.  (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed the file-name duplicate-removal code when dealing with multiple
      dups in a row. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed a bug that caused rsync to lose the exit status of its child
      processes and sometimes return an exit code of 0 instead of showing
      an error.  (David R. Staples, Dave Dykstra)

    * Fixed bug in --copy-unsafe-links that caused it to be completely
      broken.  (Dave Dykstra)

    * Prevent infinite recursion in cleanup code under certain circumstances.
      (Sviatoslav Sviridov and Marc Espie)

    * Fixed a bug that prevented rsync from creating intervening directories
      when --relative-paths/-R is set.  (Craig Barratt)

    * Prevent "Connection reset by peer" messages from Cygwin. (Randy O'Meara)

  INTERNAL:

    * Many code cleanups and improved internal documentation.  (Martin
      Pool, Nelson Beebe)

    * Portability fixes. (Dave Dykstra and Wayne Davison)

    * More test cases.  (Martin Pool)

    * Some test-case fixes.  (Brian Poole, Wayne Davison)

    * Updated included popt to the latest vendor drop, version 1.6.4.
      (Jos Backus)

    * Updated config.guess and config.sub to latest versions; this
      means rsync should build on more platforms.  (Paul Green)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.5, aka Snowy River (2 Apr 2002)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.4:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With --progress, when a transfer is complete show the time taken;
      otherwise show expected time to complete. (Cameron Simpson)

    * Make "make install-strip" works properly, and "make install"
      accepts a DESTDIR variable for help in building binary packages.
      (Peter Breitenlohner, Greg Louis)

    * If configured with --enable-maintainer-mode, then on receipt of
      a fatal signal rsync will try to open an xterm running gdb,
      similarly to Samba's "panic action" or GNOME's bug-buddy.
      (Martin Pool)


  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix situation where failure to fork (e.g. because out of process
      slots) would cause rsync to kill all processes owned by the
      current user.  Yes, really!  (Paul Haas, Martin Pool)

    * Fix test suite on Solaris.  (Jos Backus, Martin Pool)

    * Fix minor memory leak in socket code.  (Dave Dykstra, Martin
      Pool.)

    * Fix --whole-file problem that caused it to be the default even
      for remote connections.  (Martin Pool, Frank Schulz)

    * Work around bug in Mac OS X mkdir(2), which cannot handle
      trailing slashes.
      <http://www.opensource.apple.com/bugs/X/BSD%20Kernel/2734739.html>
      (Martin Pool)

      Tridgell) (CVE CAN-2002-0059)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Merge in changes from zlib 1.1.3 to zlib 1.1.4.  (Jos Backus)
      (Note that rsync still uses a custom version of zlib; you can
      not just link against a system library.  See zlib/README.rsync)

NEWS for rsync 2.5.3, aka "Happy 26" (11 Mar 2002)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.2:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    * Make sure that supplementary groups are removed from a server
      process after changing uid and gid. (Ethan Benson) (Debian bug
      #132272, CVE CAN-2002-0080)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix zlib double-free bug.  (Owen Taylor, Mark J Cox) (CVE
      CAN-2002-0059)

    * Fixed problem that in many cases caused the error message
	unexpected read size of 0 in map_ptr
      and resulted in the wrong data being copied.

    * Fixed compilation errors on some systems caused by the use of
      "unsigned int64" in rsync.h.

    * Fixed problem on systems such as Sunos4 that do not support realloc
      on a NULL pointer; error was "out of memory in flist_expand".

    * Fix for rsync server processes hanging around after the client
      unexpectedly disconnects.  (Colin Walters) (Debian bug #128632)

    * Cope with BSD systems on which mkdir() will not accept a trailing
      slash.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Merge in changes from zlib 1.1.2 to zlib 1.1.3.  (Note that
      rsync still uses a custom version of zlib; you can not just link
      against a system library.  See zlib/README.rsync)

    * Command to initiate connections is only shown with -vv, rather
      than -v as in 2.5.2.  Output from plain -v is more similar to
      what was historically used so as not to break scripts that try
      to parse the output.

    * Added --no-whole-file and --no-blocking-io options (Dave Dykstra)

    * Made the --write-batch and --read-batch options actually work
      and added documentation in the man page (Jos Backus)

    * If the daemon is unable to fork a child to accept a connection,
      print an error message.  (Colin Walters)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.2 (26 Jan 2002)
Protocol: 26 (changed)
Changes since 2.5.1:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    * Signedness security patch from Sebastian Krahmer
      <krahmer@suse.de> -- in some cases we were not sufficiently
      careful about reading integers from the network.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix possible string mangling in log files.

    * Fix for setting local address of outgoing sockets.

    * Better handling of hardlinks and devices on platforms with
      64-bit dev_t or ino_t.

    * Name resolution on machines supporting IPv6 is improved.

    * Fix for device nodes.  (dann frazier)   (Debian #129135)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With -v, rsync now shows the command used to initiate an ssh/rsh
      connection.

    * --statistics now shows memory heap usage on platforms that
      support mallinfo().

    * "The Ted T'so school of program optimization": make progress
      visible and people will think it's faster.  (With --progress,
      rsync will show you how many files it has seen as it builds the
      file_list, giving some indication that it has not hung.)

    * Improvements to batch mode support.  This is still experimental
      but testing would be welcome.   (Jos Backus)

    * New --ignore-existing option, patch previously distributed with
      Vipul's Razor.  (Debian #124286)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.1 (3 Jan 2002)
Protocol: 25 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.0:

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix for segfault in --daemon mode configuration parser.  (Paul
      Mackerras)

    * Correct string<->address parsing for both IPv4 and 6.
      (YOSHIFUJI Hideaki, SUMIKAWA Munechika and Jun-ichiro "itojun"
      Hagino)

    * Various fixes for IPv6 support.  (Dave Dykstra)

    * rsync.1 typo fix.  (Matt Kraai)

    * Test suite typo fixes.  (Tom Schmidt)

    * rsync.1 grammar and clarity improvements.  (Edward
      Welbourne)

    * Correction to ./configure tests for inet_ntop.  (Jeff Garzik)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * --progress and -P now show estimated data transfer rate (in a
      multiple of bytes/s) and estimated time to completion.  (Rik
      Faith)

    * --no-detach option, required to run as a W32 service and also
      useful when running on Unix under daemontools, AIX's SRC, or a
      debugger.  (Max Bowsher, Jos Backus)

    * Clearer error messages for some conditions.


NEWS for rsync 2.5.0 (30 Nov 2001)
Protocol: 25 (changed)
Changes since 2.4.6:

  ANNOUNCEMENTS

    * Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org> is now a co-maintainer.

  NEW FEATURES

    * Support for LSB-compliant packaging <http://www.linuxbase.org/>

    * Shell wildcards are allowed in "auth users" lines.

    * Merged UNC rsync+ patch to support creation of standalone patch
      sets.  By Bert J. Dempsey and Debra Weiss, updated by Jos
      Backus.  <http://www.ils.unc.edu/i2dsi/unc_rsync+.html>

    * IPv6 support based on a patch from KAME.net, on systems
      including modern versions of Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX.  Also
      includes IPv6 compatibility functions for old OSs by the
      Internet Software Consortium, Paul Vixie, the OpenSSH
      portability project, and OpenBSD.

  ENHANCEMENTS

    * Include/exclude cluestick: with -vv, print out whether files are
      included or excluded and why.

    * Many error messages have more friendly explanations and more
      details.

    * Manual page improvements plus scanty protocol documentation.

    * When running as --daemon in the background and using a "log
      file" rsyncd.conf directive, close the log file every time it is
      open when going to sleep on the socket.  This allows the log
      file to get cleaned out by another process.

    * Change to using libpopt rather than getopt for processing
      options.	This makes the code cleaner and the behaviour more
      consistent across platforms.  popt is included and built if not
      installed on the platform.

    * More details in --version, including note about whether 64-bit
      files, symlinks and hardlinks are supported.

    * MD4 code may use less CPU cycles.

    * Use mkstemp on systems where it is secure.  If we use mktemp,
      explain that we do it in a secure way.

    * --whole-file is the default when source and target are on the
	local machine.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix for various bugs causing rsync to hang.

    * Attempt to fix Large File Summit support on AIX.

    * Attempt to fix error handling lockup bug.

    * Give a non-0 exit code if *any* of the files we have been asked
      to transfer fail to transfer.

    * For log messages containing ridiculously long strings that might
      overflow a buffer rsync no longer aborts, but rather prints an
      ellipsis at the end of the string.  (Patch from Ed Santiago.)

  PLATFORMS:

    * Improved support for UNICOS (tested on Cray T3E and Cray SV1)

    * autoconf2.52 (or later) is now required to rebuild the autoconf
      scripts.  It is not required to simply build rsync.
