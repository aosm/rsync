NEWS for rsync 2.6.0 (1 Jan 2004)
Protocol: 27 (changed)
Changes since 2.5.7:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * "ssh" is now the default remote shell for rsync.  If you want to
      change this, configure like this:  "./configure --with-rsh=rsh".

    * Added --files-from, --no-relative, --no-implied-dirs, and --from0.
      Note that --from0 affects the line-ending character for all the
      files read by the --*-from options. (Wayne Davison)

    * Length of csum2 is now per-file starting with protocol version
      27. (J.W. Schultz)

    * Per-file dynamic block size is now sqrt(file length).  The
      per-file checksum size is determined according to an algorithm
      provided by Donovan Baarda which reduces the probability of rsync
      algorithm corrupting data and falling back using the whole md4
      checksums. (J.W. Schultz, Donovan Baarda)

    * The --stats option no longer includes the (debug) malloc summary
      unless the verbose option was specified at least twice.

    * Added a new error/warning code for when files vanish from the
      sending side.  Made vanished source files not interfere with the
      file-deletion pass when --delete-after was specified.

    * Various trailing-info sections are now preceded by a newline.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed several exclude/include matching bugs when using wild-cards.
      This has a several user-visible effects, all of which make the
      matching more consistent and intuitive.  This should hopefully not
      cause anyone problems since it makes the matching work more like
      what people are expecting. (Wayne Davison)

      - A pattern with a "**" no longer causes a "*" to match slashes.
        For example, with "/*/foo/**", "foo" must be 2 levels deep.
	[If your string has BOTH "*" and "**" wildcards, changing the
	"*" wildcards to "**" will provide the old behavior in all
	versions.]

      - "**/foo" now matches at the base of the transfer (like /foo
        does).  [Use "/**/foo" to get the old behavior in all versions.]

      - A non-anchored wildcard term floats to match beyond the base of
        the transfer.  E.g. "CVS/R*" matches at the end of the path,
        just like the non-wildcard term "CVS/Root" does. [Use "/CVS/R*"
        to get the old behavior in all versions.]

      - Including a "**" in the match term causes it to be matched
        against the entire path, not just the name portion, even if
        there aren't any interior slashes in the term.  E.g. "foo**bar"
        would exclude "/path/foo-bar" (just like before) as well as
        "/foo-path/baz-bar" (unlike before).  [Use "foo*bar" to get the
        old behavior in all versions.]

    * The exclude list specified in the daemon's config file is now
      properly applied to the pulled items no matter how deep the
      user's file-args are in the source tree.  (Wayne Davison)

    * For protocol version >= 27, mdfour_tail() is called when the
      block size (including checksum_seed) is a multiple of 64.
      Previously it was not called, giving the wrong MD4 checksum.
      (Craig Barratt)

    * For protocol version >= 27, a 64 bit bit counter is used in
      mdfour.c as required by the RFC.  Previously only a 32 bit bit
      counter was used, causing incorrect MD4 file checksums for
      file sizes >= 512MB - 4.  (Craig Barratt)

    * Fixed a crash bug when interacting with older rsync versions and
      multiple files of the same name are destined for the same dir.
      (Wayne Davison)

    * Keep tmp names from overflowing MAXPATHLEN.

    * Make --link-dest honor the absence of -p, -o, and -g.

    * Made rsync treat a trailing slash in the destination in a more
      consistent manner.

    * Fixed file I/O error detection.  (John Van Essen)

    * Fixed bogus "malformed address {hostname}" message in rsyncd log
      when checking IP address against hostnames from "hosts allow"
      and "hosts deny" parameters in config file.

    * Print heap statistics when verbose >= 2 instead of when >= 1.

    * Fixed a compression (-z) bug when syncing a mostly-matching file
      that contains already-compressed data.  (Yasuoka Masahiko and
      Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed a bug in the --backup code that could cause deleted files
      to not get backed up.

    * When the backup code makes new directories, create them with mode
      0700 instead of 0755 (since the directory permissions in the
      backup tree are not yet copied from the main tree).

    * Call setgroups() in a more portable manner.

    * Improved file-related error messages to better indicate exactly
      what pathname failed. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed some bugs in the handling of --delete and --exclude when
      using the --relative (-R) option. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed bug that prevented regular files from replacing
      special files and caused a directory in --link-dest or
      --compare-dest to block the creation of a file with the
      same path.  A directory still cannot be replaced by a
      regular file unless --delete specified.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * Detect and report when open or opendir succeed but read and
      readdir fail caused by network filesystem issues and truncated
      files.  (David Norwood, Michael Brown, J.W. Schultz)

    * Added a fix that should give ssh time to restore the tty settings
      if the user presses Ctrl-C at an ssh password prompt.

  INTERNAL:

    * Eliminated vestigial support for old versions that we stopped
      supporting. (J.W. Schultz)

    * Simplified some of the option-parsing code. (Wayne Davison)

    * Some cleanup made to the exclude code, as well as some new
      defines added to enhance readability. (Wayne Davison)

    * Changed the protocol-version code so that it can interact at a
      lower protocol level than the maximum supported by both sides.
      Added an undocumented option, --protocol=N, to force the value
      we advertise to the other side (primarily for testing purposes).
      (Wayne Davison)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.7 (4 Dec 2003)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.6:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    * Fix buffer handling bugs.  (Andrew Tridgell, Martin Pool, Paul
      Russell, Andrea Barisani)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.6, aka "the dwd-between-jobs release" (26 Jan 2003)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.5:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * The --delete-after option now implies --delete.  (Wayne Davison)

    * The --suffix option can now be used with --backup-dir.  (Michael
      Zimmerman)

    * Combining "::" syntax with the -rsh/-e option now uses the
      specified remote-shell as a transport to talk to a (newly-spawned)
      server-daemon.  This allows someone to use daemon features, such
      as modules, over a secure protocol, such as ssh.  (JD Paul)

    * The rsync:// syntax for daemon connections is now accepted in the
      destination field.

    * If the file name given to --include-from or --exclude-from is "-",
      rsync will read from standard input.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * New option --link-dest which is like --compare-dest except that
      unchanged files are hard-linked in to the destination directory.
      (J.W. Schultz)

    * Don't report an error if an excluded file disappears during an
      rsync run.  (Eugene Chupriyanov and Bo Kersey)

    * Added .svn to --cvs-exclude list to support subversion.  (Jon
      Middleton)

    * Properly support IPv6 addresses in the rsyncd.conf "hosts allow"
      and "hosts deny" fields.  (Hideaki Yoshifuji)

    * Changed exclude file handling to permit DOS or MAC style line
      terminations.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * Ignore errors from chmod when -p/-a/--preserve-perms is not set.
      (Dave Dykstra)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix "forward name lookup failed" errors on AIX 4.3.3.  (John
      L. Allen, Martin Pool)

    * Generate each file's rolling-checksum data as we send it, not
      in a separate (memory-eating) pass before hand.  This prevents
      timeout errors on really large files. (Stefan Nehlsen)

    * Fix compilation on Tru64.  (Albert Chin, Zoong Pham)

    * Better handling of some client-server errors.  (Martin Pool)

    * Fixed a crash that would occur when sending a list of files that
      contains a duplicate name (if it sorts to the end of the file
      list) and using --delete.  (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed the file-name duplicate-removal code when dealing with multiple
      dups in a row. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed a bug that caused rsync to lose the exit status of its child
      processes and sometimes return an exit code of 0 instead of showing
      an error.  (David R. Staples, Dave Dykstra)

    * Fixed bug in --copy-unsafe-links that caused it to be completely
      broken.  (Dave Dykstra)

    * Prevent infinite recursion in cleanup code under certain circumstances.
      (Sviatoslav Sviridov and Marc Espie)

    * Fixed a bug that prevented rsync from creating intervening directories
      when --relative-paths/-R is set.  (Craig Barratt)

    * Prevent "Connection reset by peer" messages from Cygwin. (Randy O'Meara)

  INTERNAL:

    * Many code cleanups and improved internal documentation.  (Martin
      Pool, Nelson Beebe)

    * Portability fixes. (Dave Dykstra and Wayne Davison)

    * More test cases.  (Martin Pool)

    * Some test-case fixes.  (Brian Poole, Wayne Davison)

    * Updated included popt to the latest vendor drop, version 1.6.4.
      (Jos Backus)

    * Updated config.guess and config.sub to latest versions; this
      means rsync should build on more platforms.  (Paul Green)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.5, aka Snowy River (2 Apr 2002)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.4:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With --progress, when a transfer is complete show the time taken;
      otherwise show expected time to complete. (Cameron Simpson)

    * Make "make install-strip" works properly, and "make install"
      accepts a DESTDIR variable for help in building binary packages.
      (Peter Breitenlohner, Greg Louis)

    * If configured with --enable-maintainer-mode, then on receipt of
      a fatal signal rsync will try to open an xterm running gdb,
      similarly to Samba's "panic action" or GNOME's bug-buddy.
      (Martin Pool)


  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix situation where failure to fork (e.g. because out of process
      slots) would cause rsync to kill all processes owned by the
      current user.  Yes, really!  (Paul Haas, Martin Pool)

    * Fix test suite on Solaris.  (Jos Backus, Martin Pool)

    * Fix minor memory leak in socket code.  (Dave Dykstra, Martin
      Pool.)

    * Fix --whole-file problem that caused it to be the default even
      for remote connections.  (Martin Pool, Frank Schulz)

    * Work around bug in Mac OS X mkdir(2), which cannot handle
      trailing slashes.
      <http://www.opensource.apple.com/bugs/X/BSD%20Kernel/2734739.html>
      (Martin Pool)

    * Improved network error handling.  (Greg A. Woods)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.4, aka "Imitation lizard skin" (13 Mar 2002)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    * Additional fix for zlib double-free bug.  (Martin Pool, Andrew
      Tridgell) (CVE CAN-2002-0059)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Merge in changes from zlib 1.1.3 to zlib 1.1.4.  (Jos Backus)
      (Note that rsync still uses a custom version of zlib; you can
      not just link against a system library.  See zlib/README.rsync)

    * Additional test cases for --compress.  (Martin Pool)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.3, aka "Happy 26" (11 Mar 2002)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.2:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    * Make sure that supplementary groups are removed from a server
      process after changing uid and gid. (Ethan Benson) (Debian bug
      #132272, CVE CAN-2002-0080)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix zlib double-free bug.  (Owen Taylor, Mark J Cox) (CVE
      CAN-2002-0059)

    * Fixed problem that in many cases caused the error message
	unexpected read size of 0 in map_ptr
      and resulted in the wrong data being copied.

    * Fixed compilation errors on some systems caused by the use of
      "unsigned int64" in rsync.h.

    * Fixed problem on systems such as Sunos4 that do not support realloc
      on a NULL pointer; error was "out of memory in flist_expand".

    * Fix for rsync server processes hanging around after the client
      unexpectedly disconnects.  (Colin Walters) (Debian bug #128632)

    * Cope with BSD systems on which mkdir() will not accept a trailing
      slash.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Merge in changes from zlib 1.1.2 to zlib 1.1.3.  (Note that
      rsync still uses a custom version of zlib; you can not just link
      against a system library.  See zlib/README.rsync)

    * Command to initiate connections is only shown with -vv, rather
      than -v as in 2.5.2.  Output from plain -v is more similar to
      what was historically used so as not to break scripts that try
      to parse the output.

    * Added --no-whole-file and --no-blocking-io options (Dave Dykstra)

    * Made the --write-batch and --read-batch options actually work
      and added documentation in the man page (Jos Backus)

    * If the daemon is unable to fork a child to accept a connection,
      print an error message.  (Colin Walters)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.2 (26 Jan 2002)
Protocol: 26 (changed)
Changes since 2.5.1:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    * Signedness security patch from Sebastian Krahmer
      <krahmer@suse.de> -- in some cases we were not sufficiently
      careful about reading integers from the network.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix possible string mangling in log files.

    * Fix for setting local address of outgoing sockets.

    * Better handling of hardlinks and devices on platforms with
      64-bit dev_t or ino_t.

    * Name resolution on machines supporting IPv6 is improved.

    * Fix for device nodes.  (dann frazier)   (Debian #129135)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With -v, rsync now shows the command used to initiate an ssh/rsh
      connection.

    * --statistics now shows memory heap usage on platforms that
      support mallinfo().

    * "The Ted T'so school of program optimization": make progress
      visible and people will think it's faster.  (With --progress,
      rsync will show you how many files it has seen as it builds the
      file_list, giving some indication that it has not hung.)

    * Improvements to batch mode support.  This is still experimental
      but testing would be welcome.   (Jos Backus)

    * New --ignore-existing option, patch previously distributed with
      Vipul's Razor.  (Debian #124286)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.1 (3 Jan 2002)
Protocol: 25 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.0:

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix for segfault in --daemon mode configuration parser.  (Paul
      Mackerras)

    * Correct string<->address parsing for both IPv4 and 6.
      (YOSHIFUJI Hideaki, SUMIKAWA Munechika and Jun-ichiro "itojun"
      Hagino)

    * Various fixes for IPv6 support.  (Dave Dykstra)

    * rsync.1 typo fix.  (Matt Kraai)

    * Test suite typo fixes.  (Tom Schmidt)

    * rsync.1 grammar and clarity improvements.  (Edward
      Welbourne)

    * Correction to ./configure tests for inet_ntop.  (Jeff Garzik)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * --progress and -P now show estimated data transfer rate (in a
      multiple of bytes/s) and estimated time to completion.  (Rik
      Faith)

    * --no-detach option, required to run as a W32 service and also
      useful when running on Unix under daemontools, AIX's SRC, or a
      debugger.  (Max Bowsher, Jos Backus)

    * Clearer error messages for some conditions.


NEWS for rsync 2.5.0 (30 Nov 2001)
Protocol: 25 (changed)
Changes since 2.4.6:

  ANNOUNCEMENTS

    * Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org> is now a co-maintainer.

  NEW FEATURES

    * Support for LSB-compliant packaging <http://www.linuxbase.org/>

    * Shell wildcards are allowed in "auth users" lines.

    * Merged UNC rsync+ patch to support creation of standalone patch
      sets.  By Bert J. Dempsey and Debra Weiss, updated by Jos
      Backus.  <http://www.ils.unc.edu/i2dsi/unc_rsync+.html>

    * IPv6 support based on a patch from KAME.net, on systems
      including modern versions of Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX.  Also
      includes IPv6 compatibility functions for old OSs by the
      Internet Software Consortium, Paul Vixie, the OpenSSH
      portability project, and OpenBSD.

  ENHANCEMENTS

    * Include/exclude cluestick: with -vv, print out whether files are
      included or excluded and why.

    * Many error messages have more friendly explanations and more
      details.

    * Manual page improvements plus scanty protocol documentation.

    * When running as --daemon in the background and using a "log
      file" rsyncd.conf directive, close the log file every time it is
      open when going to sleep on the socket.  This allows the log
      file to get cleaned out by another process.

    * Change to using libpopt rather than getopt for processing
      options.	This makes the code cleaner and the behaviour more
      consistent across platforms.  popt is included and built if not
      installed on the platform.

    * More details in --version, including note about whether 64-bit
      files, symlinks and hardlinks are supported.

    * MD4 code may use less CPU cycles.

    * Use mkstemp on systems where it is secure.  If we use mktemp,
      explain that we do it in a secure way.

    * --whole-file is the default when source and target are on the
	local machine.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix for various bugs causing rsync to hang.

    * Attempt to fix Large File Summit support on AIX.

    * Attempt to fix error handling lockup bug.

    * Give a non-0 exit code if *any* of the files we have been asked
      to transfer fail to transfer.

    * For log messages containing ridiculously long strings that might
      overflow a buffer rsync no longer aborts, but rather prints an
      ellipsis at the end of the string.  (Patch from Ed Santiago.)

  PLATFORMS:

    * Improved support for UNICOS (tested on Cray T3E and Cray SV1)

    * autoconf2.52 (or later) is now required to rebuild the autoconf
      scripts.  It is not required to simply build rsync.
