Handling IPv6 on old machines

  The KAME IPv6 patch is nice in theory but has proved a bit of a
  nightmare in practice.  The basic idea of their patch is that rsync
  is rewritten to use the new getaddrinfo()/getnameinfo() interface,
  rather than gethostbyname()/gethostbyaddr() as in rsync 2.4.6.
  Systems that don't have the new interface are handled by providing
  our own implementation in lib/, which is selectively linked in.

  The problem with this is that it is really hard to get right on
  platforms that have a half-working implementation, so redefining
  these functions clashes with system headers, and leaving them out
  breaks.  This affects at least OSF/1, RedHat 5, and Cobalt, which
  are moderately improtant.

  Perhaps the simplest solution would be to have two different files
  implementing the same interface, and choose either the new or the
  old API.  This is probably necessary for systems that e.g. have
  IPv6, but gethostbyaddr() can't handle it.  The Linux manpage claims
  this is currently the case.

  In fact, our internal sockets interface (things like
  open_socket_out(), etc) is much narrower than the getaddrinfo()
  interface, and so probably simpler to get right.  In addition, the
  old code is known to work well on old machines.

  We could drop the rather large lib/getaddrinfo files.

                      --          --


Other IPv6 stuff:
  
  Implement suggestions from http://www.kame.net/newsletter/19980604/
  and ftp://ftp.iij.ad.jp/pub/RFC/rfc2553.txt

  If a host has multiple addresses, then listen try to connect to all
  in order until we get through.  (getaddrinfo may return multiple
  addresses.)  This is kind of implemented already.

  Possibly also when starting as a server we may need to listen on
  multiple passive addresses.  This might be a bit harder, because we
  may need to select on all of them.  Hm.

  Define a syntax for IPv6 literal addresses.  Since they include
  colons, they tend to break most naming systems, including ours.
  Based on the HTTP IPv6 syntax, I think we should use
 
     rsync://[::1]/foo/bar [::1]::bar

  which should just take a small change to the parser code.

                      --          --


Add ACL support							2001/12/02

  Transfer ACLs.  Need to think of a standard representation.
  Probably better not to even try to convert between NT and POSIX.
  Possibly can share some code with Samba.

                      --          --


Lazy directory creation

  With the current common --include '*/' --exclude '*' pattern, people
  can end up with many empty directories.  We might avoid this by
  lazily creating such directories.

                      --          --


proxy authentication						2002/01/23

  Allow RSYNC_PROXY to be http://user:pass@proxy.foo:3128/, and do
  HTTP Basic Proxy-Authentication.

  Multiple schemes are possible, up to and including the insanity that
  is NTLM, but Basic probably covers most cases.

                      --          --


SOCKS								2002/01/23

  Add --with-socks, and then perhaps a command-line option to put them
  on or off.  This might be more reliable than LD_PRELOAD hacks.

                      --          --


FAT support

  rsync to a FAT partition on a Unix machine doesn't work very well at
  the moment.  I think we get errors about invalid filenames and
  perhaps also trying to do atomic renames.

  I guess the code to do this is currently #ifdef'd on Windows;
  perhaps we ought to intelligently fall back to it on Unix too.

                      --          --

  I think that would be good too.  For example, people uploading files
  to a web server might like to say

  rsync -avzP --chmod a+rX ./ sourcefrog.net:/home/www/sourcefrog/

  Ideally the patch would implement as many of the gnu chmod semantics
  as possible.  I think the mode parser should be a separate function
  that passes back something like (mask,set) description to the rest
  of the program.  For bonus points there would be a test case for the
  parser.

--diff						david.e.sewell	2002/03/15

  Allow people to specify the diff command.  (Might want to use wdiff,
  gnudiff, etc.)

  Just diff the temporary file with the destination file, and delete
  the tmp file rather than moving it into place.

  Interaction with --partial.

Create more granular verbosity				jw	2003/05/15

  Control output with the --report option.

  The option takes as a single argument (no whitespace) a
  comma delimited lists of keywords.

  This would separate debugging from "logging" as well as
  fine grained selection of statistical reporting and what
  actions are logged.

  support.

LOGGING --------------------------------------------------------------

Make dry run list all updates					2002/04/03

  --dry-run is too dry

  Mark Santcroos points out that -n fails to list files which have
  only metadata changes, though it probably should.

  There may be a Debian bug about this as well.

                      --          --


Memory accounting

  At exit, show how much memory was used for the file list, etc.

  Also we do a wierd exponential-growth allocation in flist.c.  I'm
  not sure this makes sense with modern mallocs.  At any rate it will
  make us allocate a huge amount of memory for large file lists.

                      --          --


Improve error messages

  If we hang or get SIGINT, then explain where we were up to.  Perhaps
  have a static buffer that contains the current function name, or
  some kind of description of what we were trying to do.  This is a
  little easier on people than needing to run strace/truss.

  "The dungeon collapses!  You are killed."  Rather than "unexpected
  eof" give a message that is more detailed if possible and also more
  helpful.

  If we get an error writing to a socket, then we should perhaps
  continue trying to read to see if an error message comes across
  explaining why the socket is closed.  I'm not sure if this would
  work, but it would certainly make our messages more helpful.

  What happens if a directory is missing -x attributes.  Do we lose
  our load?  (Debian #28416) Probably fixed now, but a test case would
  be good.

  When running as a daemon, some errors should both be returned to the
  user and logged.  This will make interacting with a daemon less
  cryptic.

                      --          --


Better statistics:					Rasmus	2002/03/08

  <Rasmus>
      hey, how about an rsync option that just gives you the
      summary without the list of files?  And perhaps gives
      more information like the number of new files, number
      of changed, deleted, etc. ?

  <mbp>
      nice idea there is --stats but at the moment it's very
      tridge-oriented rather than user-friendly it would be
      nice to improve it that would also work well with
      --dryrun

                      --          --

  monitor progress in a log file can do so more easily.  See

  generator): ".

  123123 newer than 1283198")

internationalization

  Change to using gettext().  Probably need to ship this for platforms
  that don't have it.

  Solicit translations.

  Does anyone care?  Before we bother modifying the code, we ought to
  get the manual translated first, because that's possibly more useful
  and at any rate demonstrates desire.

                      --          --

DEVELOPMENT --------------------------------------------------------

Handling duplicate names

  We need to be careful of duplicate names getting into the file list.
  See clean_flist().  This could happen if multiple arguments include
  the same file.  Bad.

  I think duplicates are only a problem if they're both flowing
  through the pipeline at the same time.  For example we might have
  updated the first occurrence after reading the checksums for the
  second.  So possibly we just need to make sure that we don't have
  both in the pipeline at the same time.

  Possibly if we did one directory at a time that would be sufficient.

  Alternatively we could pre-process the arguments to make sure no
  duplicates will ever be inserted.  There could be some bad cases
  when we're collapsing symlinks.

  We could have a hash table.

  The root of the problem is that we do not want more than one file
  list entry referring to the same file.  At first glance there are
  several ways this could happen: symlinks, hardlinks, and repeated
  names on the command line.

  If names are repeated on the command line, they may be present in
  different forms, perhaps by traversing directory paths in different
  ways, traversing paths including symlinks.  Also we need to allow
  for expansion of globs by rsync.

  At the moment, clean_flist() requires having the entire file list in
  memory.  Duplicate names are detected just by a string comparison.

  We don't need to worry about hard links causing duplicates because
  files are never updated in place.  Similarly for symlinks.

  I think even if we're using a different symlink mode we don't need
  to worry.

  Unless we're really clever this will introduce a protocol
  incompatibility, so we need to be able to accept the old format as
  well.

                      --          --


Use generic zlib						2002/02/25

  Perhaps don't use our own zlib.

  Advantages:
   
    - will automatically be up to date with bugfixes in zlib

    - can leave it out for small rsync on e.g. recovery disks

    - can use a shared library

    - avoids people breaking rsync by trying to do this themselves and
      messing up

  Should we ship zlib for systems that don't have it, or require
  people to install it separately?

  Apparently this will make us incompatible with versions of rsync
  that use the patched version of rsync.  Probably the simplest way to
  do this is to just disable gzip (with a warning) when talking to old
  versions.

                      --          --


TDB:								2002/03/12

  Rather than storing the file list in memory, store it in a TDB.

  This *might* make memory usage lower while building the file list.

  Hashtable lookup will mean files are not transmitted in order,
  though... hm.

  This would neatly eliminate one of the major post-fork shared data
  structures.

                      --          --


Splint								2002/03/12

  Build rsync with SPLINT to try to find security holes.  Add
  annotations as necessary.  Keep track of the number of warnings
  found initially, and see how many of them are real bugs, or real
  security bugs.  Knowing the percentage of likely hits would be
  really interesting for other projects.

PERFORMANCE ----------------------------------------------------------

File list structure in memory

  Rather than one big array, perhaps have a tree in memory mirroring
  the directory tree.

  This might make sorting much faster!  (I'm not sure it's a big CPU
  problem, mind you.)

  It might also reduce memory use in storing repeated directory names
  -- again I'm not sure this is a problem.

                      --          --


Traverse just one directory at a time

  Traverse just one directory at a time.  Tridge says it's possible.

  At the moment rsync reads the whole file list into memory at the
  start, which makes us use a lot of memory and also not pipeline
  network access as much as we could.

                      --          --


Allow skipping MD4 file_sum					2002/04/08

  If we're doing a local transfer, or using -W, then perhaps don't
  send the file checksum.  If we're doing a local transfer, then
  calculating MD4 checksums uses 90% of CPU and is unlikely to be
  useful.

  Indeed for transfers over zlib or ssh we can also rely on the
  transport to have quite strong protection against corruption.

  Perhaps we should have an option to disable this,
  analogous to --whole-file, although it would default to
  disabled.  The file checksum takes up a definite space in
  the protocol -- we can either set it to 0, or perhaps just
  leave it out.

                      --          --


Accelerate MD4

  Perhaps borrow an assembler MD4 from someone?

  Make sure we call MD4 with properly-sized blocks whenever possible
  to avoid copying into the residue region?

                      --          --

TESTING --------------------------------------------------------------

Torture test

  Something that just keeps running rsync continuously over a data set
  likely to generate problems.

                      --          --


Cross-test versions						2001/08/22

  Part of the regression suite should be making sure that we
  don't break backwards compatibility: old clients vs new
  servers and so on.  Ideally we would test both up and down
  from the current release to all old versions.

  Run current rsync versions against significant past releases.

  We might need to omit broken old versions, or versions in which
  particular functionality is broken

  It might be sufficient to test downloads from well-known public
  rsync servers running different versions of rsync.  This will give
  some testing and also be the most common case for having different
  versions and not being able to upgrade.

  The new --protocol option may help in this.

                      --          --


Test on kernel source

  Download all versions of kernel; unpack, sync between them.  Also
  sync between uncompressed tarballs.  Compare directories after
  transfer.

  Use local mode; ssh; daemon; --whole-file and --no-whole-file.

  Use awk to pull out the 'speedup' number for each transfer.  Make
  sure it is >= x.
