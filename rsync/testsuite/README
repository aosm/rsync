This directory contains automatic test cases for rsync.  You can run
them yourself if you want, preferably by doing "make check" in the
top-level source directory.  (Not implemented yet.)

They also run automatically on the build farm, and you can see the
results on http://build.samba.org/.  That's controlled by the file
./runlist.
